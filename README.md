# UWPWeatherApp
3rd year Mobile applications project

### Author - Gary Mannion

## Project Brief  
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices.  
These include:  
- Accelerometer or Gyroscope 
- GPS (Location Based Services) 
- Sound 
- Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc) 
- Camera 
- Multi Touch Gesture Management 

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question 

> “why will the user open this app for a second time?” 


## Project Overview
I decided to make a weather application for the city of Dublin as it is the capital of Ireland and has the highest population for any county or city in the whole entire country so would have the majority of window device users. The application will give the user the location, the current temperature, a description of the weather and an icon will appear with a representation of the weather. A second page will be available with extra weather conditions for the user to use.  

## Design Decisions
My main design decisions were originally to have the current weather for the city to display immediately and have an icon depiciting the weather conditions appear on screen. I also would have an image of Dublin(O'Connell Bridge) as my background image and to have it transparent so the text would sit better and be easier to read against compared to a normal background image. I would have a second page which will give the user the humidity, min/max temperature and the current wind speed and the current condition icon will stay displayed along with the background image.  

## Conclusion
In conclusion i learned a great amount from choosing to do a weather app as my application. I learned how to use the location services available both by using coordinates and by getting the devices current location. Howwever if i was to do this app again i would try to incorporate a 5 day forecast displayed along the bottom of the app or even an hourly update for what conditions are predicted to be like.
