# UWPWeatherApp
3rd year Mobile applications project

### Author - Gary Mannion

## Project Overview
This is the GitHub repository for my UWP windows app. I decided to make a weather application for the city of Dublin as it is the capital of Ireland and has the highest population for any county or city in the whole entire country so would have the majority of window device users.

## Design Decisions
My main design decisions were originally to have the current weather for the city to display immediately and have an icon depiciting the weather conditions appear on screen. I also would have an image of Dublin(O'Connell Bridge) as my background image and to have it transparent so the text would sit better and be easier to read against compared to a normal background image.

## Conclusion
